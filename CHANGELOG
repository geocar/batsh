	* unix/batsh.c: add the recipient address to journal name (makes
	  things faster)

2006-01-27 08:46  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: twophase hack

2006-01-23 14:21  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: yay, fix depot-doc bug, add big lock around batsh,
	  stop dspam nonsense

2005-04-04 05:39  geocar

	* doc/batsh.1: fix typo

2005-03-03 07:40  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: move concurrency check; set close-on-exec flag;
	  this allows the concurrency check to actually _work_ on solaris

2005-03-03 07:40  geocar

	* common/lock.c: use lockf on solaris; support for lockf

2004-12-14 11:20  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: absolute paths for dspam, batsh increases
	  concurrency

2004-09-27 14:47  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c, doc/batsh.1: support for user-defined closures,
	  actually cleaning up better if chdir'd, getting ARG_MAX from
	  compiler-limits.

2004-09-27 14:02  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: support commands in "!" mode that begin with "exec"
	  or "exit" :)

2004-09-24 14:47  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c, doc/batsh.1: sf-report now calls dspam cron
	  (finally), batsh has some bugfixes with regards to exec and exit
	  handling.

2004-09-23 20:20  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: batch treats exec and exit commands specially for
	  "!" commands. this way, svfilter doesn't need crazy reordering
	  rules...

2004-07-26 18:23  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: bugfixes for when qmail is going "really really"
	  fast, rewind more often, and line fix

2004-06-16 00:15  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: suexec2 program add (possibly unnecessary, here's
	  to hoping!) and support for system-wide default concurrencies...

2004-06-11 17:51  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: lowered concurrency down to 3

2004-06-11 16:19  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: close fd1 and 2 when forking so we can disconnect
	  from qmail-local

2004-06-09 20:08  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c, common/lock.c, doc/batsh.1: make the locking code
	  sane, add tracing code to batsh, error reporting to maildir,
	  shorter journal names, overflow fixes to batsh, sanity fixes.
	  batsh now works properly. smtpd now puts timeofday in received
	  header to get a better picture on concurrency. svfilter deliver
	  script now works in sandbox, and better error reporting for
	  sf-check.

2004-06-09 15:46  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: rename deliver.batsh to svfilter.batsh

2004-06-08 22:59  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c, doc/batsh.1: batsh supports multiple invocations
	  now, some better stat-tests to accomodate test(1) style
	  comparisons, and updates to the manual page.	new tool: maildir
	  does qmail-style maildir delivery and added first version of
	  batsh delivery script

2004-06-07 22:01  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c: added loop-protection, automatic
	  refrain-from-detach for mproc, some mproc queue-pulls, and some
	  world-writable protection.

2004-06-02 15:15  geocar

	* doc/batsh.1: lstat fixes, boot fixes

2004-06-01 13:52  geocar

	* doc/batsh.1: adding some documentation

2004-05-31 15:45  geocar

	* unix/batsh.c, common/lock.c: moved locking, also finished batsh
	  and added to deploy scripts
